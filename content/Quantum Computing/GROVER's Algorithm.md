### Grover's Algorithm for $( 2^x \equiv 1 \pmod{4})$

### Problem Statement

We need to find \( x \) such that:

$$ 2^x \equiv 1 \pmod{4} $$

### Classical Solution

Classically, we can solve this by checking values of \( x \):

- $2^0 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ 
- $2^0 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ 
- $2^0 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ 
- $2^0 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ 
- $2^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$
- $...$

From this, we observe that \( 2^x \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) only holds for \( x = 0 \).

### Using Grover's Algorithm

Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for searching through unsorted databases or solving unstructured search problems. To apply Grover's algorithm to find $(x)$ such that $( 2^x \equiv 1 \pmod{4})$, we need to construct a quantum oracle that marks the correct solution.

#### Steps to Apply Grover's Algorithm

1. **Oracle Construction**:
    - Create an oracle \( O \) that flips the sign of the amplitude of the state $( |x\rangle)$ if $2^x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. This can be represented as:
      $$
      O|x\rangle = \begin{cases} 
      -|x\rangle & \text{if } 2^x \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
      |x\rangle & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
      $$

2. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize a quantum register in a superposition of all possible values of $x$ using Hadamard gates:
    $$
      H^{\otimes n}|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} |x\rangle
      $$
      where \( N \) is the number of possible values of \( $x$ \).

3. **Grover Iterations**:
    - Apply the Grover diffusion operator, which inverts the amplitude of each state about the average amplitude. This step amplifies the amplitude of the solution state(s).

4. **Measurement**:
    - Measure the quantum register. The result will be the value of \( x \) that satisfies $2^x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ with high probability.

### Practical Consideration

In practice, $$ 2^x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$$ has a trivial solution $$ x = 0 $$ However, if we consider a more complex modular exponentiation problem, such as finding $x$ such that $$2^x \equiv y \pmod{N}$$ for some arbitrary $y$ and $N$, Grover's algorithm becomes more applicable. The steps would involve constructing a suitable oracle for the given problem.
