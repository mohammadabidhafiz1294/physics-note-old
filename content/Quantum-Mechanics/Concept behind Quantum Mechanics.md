### Eigen-values and Eigen-functions 
*Definition:* In quantum mechanics, #eigen-values and #eigen-functions arise from the study of operators, particularly Hermitian operators, which represent physical observables.

**Eigenvalue:** A scalar value associated with an operator that indicates the measurable quantity of a physical observable.

**Eigenfunction:** A non-zero function that, when acted upon by an operator, yields the same function multiplied by the eigenvalue.

*Mathematical Formulation*:<br/>
For an operator $\hat{A}$, the eigenvalue equation is given by:
$$
\hat{A} \psi_n(x) = a_n \psi_n(x)
$$

Where: $\hat{A}$ is the operator (e.g., position, momentum, Hamiltonian).$\psi_n(x)$ is the eigen-function corresponding to the eigenvalue $a_n$.

*Properties*

- **Real Eigenvalues:** For Hermitian operators, the eigenvalues are real numbers.
- **Orthogonal Eigenfunctions:** Eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.

*Examples*

- **Position Operator:**<br/>
   The position operator $\hat{x}$ acts on a wave function $\psi(x)$ as follows:<br/>
   $$\hat{x} \psi(x) = x \psi(x)$$<br/>
   Here, the eigenvalue is the position $x$, and the eigen-function is $\psi(x)$ itself.

- **Momentum Operator:**<br/>
   The momentum operator $$\hat{p} = -i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}$$ has eigen-functions of the form:$$\hat{p} \psi_p(x) = p \psi_p(x)$$ where $$\psi_p(x) = e^{ipx/\hbar}$$ is the eigen-function and $p$ is the eigenvalue (momentum).

- **Hamiltonian Operator (for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well)**:<br/>
   The Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$ is given by:
   $$
   \hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2}
   $$
   The eigenvalue equation becomes:$$\hat{H} \psi_n(x) = E_n \psi_n(x)$$<br/>
   The solutions (eigen-functions) are:$$\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right), \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$$<br/>
   The corresponding eigenvalues (energy levels) are:$$E_n = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2 \pi^2}{2mL^2}$$
### Hermitian Operators

*Definition:* #Hermitian-operators are linear operators that satisfy the condition:
$$
A = A^\dagger
$$
where $A^\dagger$ is the adjoint (or conjugate transpose) of the operator $A$. This means that the inner product of two states is preserved under the action of the operator.

*Properties:*
- **Real Eigenvalues:** The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are always real.
- **Orthogonal Eigenfunctions:** The eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.

*Example:* The position operator $\hat{x}$ and the momentum operator $$\hat{p} = -i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}$$ are both Hermitian operators.
### Projection Operators

*Definition:* A #projection-operator $P$ is a Hermitian operator that satisfies:<br/>
$$P^2 = P$$<br/>
This means that applying the operator twice is the same as applying it once.

*Properties:*
- Idempotent: $$P^2 = P$$
- Hermitian: $$P = P^\dagger$$<br/>
*Example:* 
- Consider a projection operator that projects a vector onto a subspace spanned by a normalized vector $|\phi\rangle$:$$P = |\phi\rangle \langle \phi|$$If you apply this operator to any state $|\psi\rangle$, it projects $|\psi\rangle$ onto the direction of $|\phi\rangle$.

- Consider a three-dimensional vector A, which can be expressed in terms of its components along three orthonormal basis vectors,$ε₁, ε₂, and ε₃$:$$|A⟩ = A₁|ε₁⟩ + A₂|ε₂⟩ + A₃|ε₃⟩$$The projection operator that projects A onto the direction of $ε₁$ is $P̂₁ = |ε₁⟩⟨ε₁|$. Applying $P̂₁ to |A⟩$ gives:$$P̂₁|A⟩ = (|ε₁⟩⟨ε₁|)(A₁|ε₁⟩ + A₂|ε₂⟩ + A₃|ε₃⟩) = A₁|ε₁⟩.$$The result is a vector that lies entirely along the direction of $ε₁$ and has a magnitude equal to the component of A in that direction.
### Expectation Values

Definition: The #expectation-value of an observable represented by a Hermitian operator $A$ in a state described by the wave function $\psi$ is given by:

$$
\langle A \rangle = \int \psi^*(x) A \psi(x) \, dx
$$

where $\psi^*(x)$ is the complex conjugate of the wave function.

*Properties:*
- The expectation value is a real number since $A$ is Hermitian.
- It represents the average value of the observable over many measurements.

Example: 
- For the momentum operator $\hat{p}$, the expectation value is:
$$
\langle \hat{p} \rangle = \int \psi^*(x) \left(-i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \psi(x) \, dx
$$
- Suppose, you want to find the expectation value of the position of a particle in a state described by the wave-function $ψ(x)$. The expectation value of the position operator $\hat{x}$ is:$$⟨\hat{x}⟩ = ⟨\psi^*| \hat{x} |ψ⟩ = ∫\psi^*(x) x ψ(x) dx*$$This integral calculates the weighted average of the position $x$, where the weight is given by the probability density $|ψ(x)|²$.

==Summary==

**Hermitian Operators**: Operators with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigen functions.<br/>
**Projection Operators**: Special Hermitian operators that project states onto subspaces.<br/>
**Expectation Values**: Average values of observables calculated using Hermitian operators.<br/>
**Eigen values:** represent measurable quantities in quantum mechanics.<br/>
**Eigen functions:** describe the state of a system corresponding to those measurements.
