### Nuclear Medicine
**Nuclear medicine** is a branch of medicine that uses radioactive substances to diagnose and treat diseases. It involves the use of radioactive materials called radiotracers, which are introduced into the body and emit radiation that can be detected by specialized imaging equipment.

Here are some key aspects of nuclear medicine:

- **Radiotracers:** These substances, also known as radio-pharmaceuticals, are chemical compounds labeled with radioisotopes. They are designed to target specific organs or tissues in the body. For instance, a radiotracer might be designed to accumulate in the bones to detect tumors or fractures. The radiotracer emits gamma rays, which can penetrate the body and be detected by a gamma camera.
- **Imaging:** Nuclear medicine imaging techniques allow doctors to visualize the function of organs and tissues, unlike traditional x-rays, which primarily show anatomical structures. This functional information helps in diagnosing a wide range of conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and thyroid disorders. One of the most common imaging techniques is **positron emission tomography (PET)**. PET scans use radiotracers that undergo beta-plus decay, emitting positrons. When a positron encounters an electron in the body, they annihilate each other, producing two gamma rays that travel in opposite directions. These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner, allowing for precise localization of the radiotracer and providing detailed images of the targeted area.
- **Therapy:** Nuclear medicine is also used for therapeutic purposes. Radioactive iodine (I-131) is often used to treat hyperthyroidism and some types of thyroid cancer. The radioactive iodine is taken up by the thyroid gland, and the emitted radiation destroys the targeted cells.
- **Safety:** Nuclear medicine procedures use very small amounts of radioactive substances, and the radiation exposure to patients is generally low. The benefits of diagnosis and treatment typically outweigh the risks associated with the radiation exposure.

Nuclear medicine is a valuable tool in modern medicine, providing important information for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of various diseases.

#### Why is gamma emitter usually chosen in nuclear medicine?
**Gamma emitters are usually chosen in nuclear medicine because gamma rays are highly penetrating, allowing them to escape the body and be detected by external imaging devices**. Gamma rays have sufficient energy to penetrate several centimeters of tissue, enabling the detection of a gamma emitter inside the body from the outside. This characteristic makes gamma emitters well-suited for diagnostic imaging procedures.

Using gamma emitters provides several **advantages** in nuclear medicine:
- **External detection**: Gamma rays can be detected outside the body, allowing for non-invasive imaging procedures. This eliminates the need for invasive procedures to locate and map the radioactive distribution within an organ.
- **Targeted imaging**: Radiotracers labeled with gamma emitters can target specific organs or tissues, providing functional information about those areas. This is in contrast to traditional x-rays, which mainly show anatomical structures.
- **Low radiation dose**: Nuclear medicine procedures typically use very small amounts of radioactive substances, resulting in generally low radiation exposure to patients.

While **beta particles** are also emitted by some radionuclides, their lack of penetration makes them less suitable for most diagnostic purposes. Beta particles are easily absorbed within the body, limiting their use to specific applications, such as the diagnosis of eye tumors where some beta particles have enough energy to emerge from the eye.

**Technetium-99m (Tc-99m)** is an example of a widely used gamma emitter in nuclear medicine. It is favored due to its ideal physical and chemical properties, including:

- **Metastable nature**: Tc-99m decays by emitting only gamma rays, reducing the radiation dose to the patient.
- **Suitable energy**: The 140 keV gamma rays emitted by Tc-99m are penetrating enough to be detected externally but are also easily shielded.
- **Short half-life**: The 6-hour half-life allows for rapid data collection during scanning procedures while minimizing the patient's total radiation exposure.

The development of Tc-99m has significantly improved nuclear medicine procedures, leading to lower radiation doses for patients compared to previously used radioisotopes like Iodine-131.

### Properties of Radioisotopes

**Key properties** considered when choosing radioisotopes for nuclear medicine include:

- **Type of emission**: Gamma emitters are preferred for most diagnostic imaging due to their penetrating power, allowing detection outside the body.
- **Energy of emission**: Gamma rays with energies between 100-300 keV are ideal for imaging, providing a balance between tissue penetration and efficient detection.
- **Half-life**: Shorter half-lives minimize radiation exposure to the patient while still allowing for adequate data collection.
- **Target specificity**: The radiotracer must be designed to target the specific organ or tissue of interest.

These factors ensure that the chosen radioisotopes provide valuable diagnostic information while minimizing risks to the patient.

#### Explain Why Tc-99m is the most suitable radionuclide for nuclear medicine procedure??

**Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is considered the most suitable radionuclide for a wide range of nuclear medicine procedures due to its unique combination of favorable physical, chemical, and biological properties**. It offers an optimal balance between providing valuable diagnostic information while minimizing radiation exposure to the patient. Here's why:

**1. Ideal Decay Characteristics:**

- **Metastable State:** Tc-99m decays by isomeric transition, emitting only **gamma rays** with an energy of 140 keV. The absence of alpha or beta particle emissions significantly reduces the radiation dose to the patient, making it safer for diagnostic procedures.
- **Optimal Gamma Energy (140 keV):** This energy is high enough to penetrate tissues and escape the body, allowing for efficient detection by gamma cameras outside the body. It's also low enough to be effectively shielded using a few millimeters of lead, minimizing radiation exposure to personnel.
- **Short Half-Life (6 hours):** This allows for the administration of sufficient activity to obtain high-quality images while ensuring rapid decay and minimal radiation burden to the patient. This rapid decay also allows for repeat studies within a short period, if necessary.

**2. Versatile Chemistry:**

- Tc-99m exhibits diverse chemistry, allowing it to be easily **chemically bound to a wide variety of pharmaceuticals and biological molecules**. This versatility enables the development of targeted radiotracers that accumulate in specific organs or tissues of interest, providing valuable diagnostic information for various medical conditions.

**3. Availability and Cost-Effectiveness:**

- Tc-99m is readily available through a **technetium-99m generator (molybdenum-99/technetium-99m generator)**. This generator system utilizes the decay of molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), which has a longer half-life of 66 hours, to continuously produce Tc-99m. Mo-99 can be easily transported over long distances and its longer decay time allows for Mo-99 to be shipped to medical facilities, where Tc-99m is extracted from the sample as it is produced.
- The generator system provides a **cost-effective and convenient source of Tc-99m** on-site, eliminating the need for frequent shipments of the short-lived radioisotope.

**4. Wide Range of Clinical Applications:**

- **Due to its favorable characteristics, Tc-99m is used in more than 70% of all nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures**. It's used to image a variety of organs and systems, including the:
    - Skeleton and heart muscle
    - Brain, thyroid, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys
    - Gall bladder, bone marrow, salivary and lachrymal glands, heart blood pool
    - Detection of infection

**In conclusion, the ideal combination of optimal decay characteristics, versatile chemistry, availability, and cost-effectiveness make Tc-99m the most suitable and widely used radionuclide for a vast array of nuclear medicine procedures.**

#### the factors which need to consider for choosing a suitable nuclear medicine.
When choosing a suitable radioisotope for a nuclear medicine procedure, several factors need careful consideration to ensure optimal diagnostic information or therapeutic effect while minimizing potential risks associated with radiation exposure. These factors include:

**1. Type of Emission**

- **Gamma emitters are generally preferred for diagnostic imaging** because gamma rays are highly penetrating, allowing for external detection using a gamma camera. This enables the visualization of internal organs and tissues without the need for invasive procedures.
- **Beta emitters, due to their shorter range and localized energy deposition, are more suitable for therapeutic applications**. They can deliver a targeted radiation dose to destroy cancerous cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues.

**2. Energy of Emission**

- The energy of the emitted radiation directly influences its penetration depth and the efficiency of detection. **Lower energy gamma rays are generally preferred for imaging to minimize patient dose while ensuring adequate tissue penetration and efficient detection by the gamma camera**.
- For therapeutic purposes, the energy of the beta particles needs to be sufficient to reach and deposit a lethal dose within the target tissue.

**3. Half-Life**

- The half-life of the radioisotope is crucial in dictating the duration of radiation exposure and the imaging or treatment time. **Shorter half-lives are generally preferred to minimize the radiation burden to the patient while still allowing for sufficient data collection**.
- **Longer half-lives may be necessary for therapeutic applications to ensure a sustained radiation dose to the target tissue**.

**4. Target Specificity**

- The radiotracer, the molecule labeled with the radioisotope, must be designed to accumulate in the specific organ or tissue of interest. This **target specificity allows for targeted imaging or therapy**, maximizing the diagnostic or therapeutic effect while minimizing unnecessary exposure to other parts of the body.

**5. Availability and Cost-Effectiveness**

- The chosen radioisotope should be **readily available and cost-effective** to ensure widespread accessibility and feasibility of the procedure.

**6. Patient-Specific Factors:**

- **The patient's age, weight, and overall health status can influence the choice of radioisotope and the administered activity**. For example, pediatric patients may require lower activities to reduce their radiation dose.

**7. Type of Procedure and Clinical Indication**

- **The specific type of nuclear medicine procedure and the clinical indication will also dictate the most appropriate radioisotope**. For example, bone scans typically use Tc-99m-labeled diphosphonates, which have a high affinity for bone tissue.

**Example: Technetium-99m**

Technetium-99m is widely regarded as the gold standard in nuclear medicine, exemplifying many of the desirable characteristics outlined above: it emits only gamma rays (140 keV), has a short half-life (6 hours), is readily available from a generator system, and exhibits versatile chemistry allowing for the labeling of a variety of molecules. It is used in more than 70% of all nuclear medicine procedures for a wide range of diagnostic applications.

### Pharmaceuticals

**Pharmaceuticals, also known as medications or drugs, are chemical substances used to prevent, diagnose, treat, or alleviate symptoms of disease**. They work by interacting with the body's biological processes to produce their desired effects.

**In nuclear medicine, a specialized type of pharmaceutical called a radiopharmaceutical is used**. These substances incorporate a radioactive isotope, also known as a radionuclide, into their structure.

Radiopharmaceuticals are administered to patients in very small amounts that do not impact normal physiological functions. The radioactive component of the radiopharmaceutical allows for the tracking and imaging of its distribution within the body, providing crucial diagnostic information about organ function and disease processes.

### Physical,biological & effective half life of a radioisotope.
The following are definitions for the physical, biological, and effective half-lives of a radioisotope:

**Physical half-life ($pT1/2$)**: The natural half-life of a radioactive isotope. It refers to the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay. This process is independent of any external factors and is a fundamental characteristic of the isotope.

**Biological half-life ($bT1/2$)**: The time it takes for half of a radioisotope to be excreted from the body through metabolic activities. Different isotopes are metabolized and excreted at different rates.

**Effective half-life ($eT1/2$):** The time it takes for the activity of a radioisotope to reduce to half when both physical decay and biological excretion occur. Mathematically, the effective half-life can be calculated using the following equation:

$$\frac{1}{eT_{1/2}} = \frac{1}{pT_{1/2}}+\frac{1}{bT_{1/2}}$$

This equation shows that the effective half-life is always shorter than both the physical and biological half-lives because both processes contribute to the reduction of radioactivity in the body.

For example, if a radioisotope has a physical half-life of 6 hours and a biological half-life of 8 hours, the effective half-life would be 3.43 hours. This means that after 3.43 hours, the activity of the radioisotope in the body would be reduced to half its original value due to a combination of physical decay and biological excretion.

### Production of Tc-99m Nuclear Medicine
Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is produced indirectly via the decay of its parent radionuclide, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99). Mo-99 has a longer half-life of 66 hours, making it suitable for transportation to medical facilities, where Tc-99m is then extracted.

-> **Production Process**
1. **Parent Nuclide: Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99)**
    
    - Tc-99m is derived from the radioactive decay of its parent isotope, Molybdenum-99.
	    
    - Mo-99 is typically produced in nuclear reactors by:
        - **Fission of Uranium-235**: When uranium-235 undergoes fission, a small percentage of the fragments are Mo-99.
		    
		    
		    This is the most common production method, used in reactors like the NRU in Canada or HFR in the Netherlands.
        - **Neutron Activation of Molybdenum-98**: A stable isotope of molybdenum is bombarded with neutrons to produce Mo-99. This method is less common.
	        
1. **Mo-99/Tc-99m Generators**
    - Once Mo-99 is produced, it is shipped to medical facilities in the form of **technetium-99m generators**, often called "moly cows."
    - The generator consists of a column containing aluminum oxide(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), which holds Mo-99 in the form of molybdate ($MoO42−MoO_4^{2-}$). As Mo-99 decays, it produces Tc-99m in the form of pertechnetate ($TcO4−TcO_4^{-}$).
3. **Elution ("Milking" the Generator)**
    
    - Tc-99m is extracted from the generator by flushing it with a saline solution. This process is known as **elution**.
    - The saline passes through the column, collecting the soluble TcO4−TcO_4^{-}, which is then used to prepare radiopharmaceuticals.
The system is often referred to as a “**technetium cow**,” and the process of extracting Tc-99m is known as “*milking*”. The generator can be milked every 6 hours or twice daily. A $Mo-99/Tc-99m$ generator is useful for about one week

#### Radiopharmaceutical Preparation
The extracted Tc-99m is incorporated into various chemical compounds to target specific organs or biological processes, such as:
    - Tc-99m sestamibi: Cardiac imaging.
    - Tc-99m sulfur colloid: Liver and spleen imaging.
    - Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP): Bone scans.
#### Advances and Challenges
1. **Alternative Production Methods**:
    - Cyclotrons: Direct production of Tc-99m by bombarding Mo-100 with protons ($100Mo(p,2n) --- >99mTc^{100}Mo(p,2n)^{99m}Tc$).
    
    - Accelerator-driven systems: Non-reactor-based production methods are being explored to reduce reliance on reactors.
2. **Global Supply Issues**:
    - Many reactors producing Mo-99 are aging, and there have been concerns about ensuring a stable global supply.
    - Efforts are underway to develop more efficient, non-HEU (Highly Enriched Uranium) based production methods.

Tc-99m's utility in non-invasive imaging makes it a cornerstone of diagnostic nuclear medicine, and innovations in production aim to ensure its availability for the future.
### Specific activity
**Specific activity** is defined as the **activity per unit mass of a radioactive material**. It essentially describes the concentration of radioactivity in a substance. Specific activity is commonly expressed in units like **becquerels per gram (Bq/g)** or **curies per gram (Ci/g)**.

**Factors Affecting Specific Activity**
Several factors can influence the specific activity of a radioactive substance, including:

- **The half-life of the radioisotope:** Isotopes with shorter half-lives exhibit higher specific activities because they decay more rapidly.
- **The presence of carrier isotopes:** Carrier-free isotopes (pure radioisotopes) have the highest possible specific activities. However, radioisotopes are often mixed with stable isotopes (carriers) of the same element, which reduces the specific activity.
- **Isotopic abundance:** In naturally occurring radioactive elements, the specific activity is influenced by the proportion of radioactive isotopes present.

**Calculating Specific Activity**

For a carrier-free radioisotope, the specific activity can be calculated using the following equation:
$$SA = \frac{A \times T}{C \times g}$$
Where:

- SA = Specific activity (Bq/g) or (Ci/gm){Bequerels per gram}{Curies per gram}
- A = Activity of the radioisotope (Bq or Ci)
- T = Time (usually in years)
- C = Atomic weight of the radioisotope (g/mol)
- g = Mass of the radioisotope (g)
**Applications of Specific Activity**
The concept of specific activity is crucial in various fields, including:
- **Radiopharmaceutical production:** Specific activity is an essential quality control parameter for radiopharmaceuticals, ensuring accurate dosing and minimizing potential side effects. For instance, the specific activity of Tc-99m pertechnetate is carefully controlled during production using a molybdenum breakthrough "pig" to measure molybdenum concentration.
- **Radiolabeling:** Determining the specific activity of a labeled compound helps researchers track the distribution and fate of the radioisotope in biological systems.
- **Environmental monitoring:** Measuring the specific activity of environmental samples can provide insights into the distribution and behavior of radioactive contaminants.

For example, I(131) is used to ensure that the radioactive isotope is effective in targeting throid tissue while minimizing the overall chemical dose.
A low specific activity is desirable,where the bulk properties of the radiopharmaceutical are crucial.
High purity isotopes yield higher specific activity. Radionuclides with generally have higher specific activities.

#### Renogram
A **renogram** is a graphical representation of radioactivity levels in each kidney over time, providing insights into their function. Renograms are generated by connecting a computer to a gamma camera during kidney imaging. The unevenness in the renogram is due to the statistical nature of the detected gamma rays. The smoothness of the count rate curve depends on the length of time the count rate is averaged.

A typical renogram takes about 30 minutes. The computer can also be used to analyze the shape of the renogram curve.

There is no mention of types of renograms in the sources provided.
#### Imaging & test for various organs

--> **Thyroid Imaging**
X-rays are not effective for visualizing tumors because they are absorbed similarly in tumor tissue and normal tissue. However, nuclear medicine images can often detect tumors. **The thyroid gland, one of the first organs to be imaged after the rectilinear scanner was developed, often develops nodules or lumps, which may be cancerous.** **A lump that does not take up radioactivity ("cold" nodule) is more likely to be cancerous than a lump that functions like thyroid tissue and takes up radioactivity.**

**Several radioisotopes can be used for thyroid imaging:**
- **Iodine-131 (¹³¹I):** This radioisotope is commonly used for thyroid scans. A typical dose of 4 MBq (approximately 100 µCi) is given orally the day before the scan. ¹³¹I is also used in larger doses for the treatment of overactive thyroids and certain thyroid cancers.
- **Technetium-99m (⁹⁹ᵐTc):** This radioisotope is preferred for thyroid imaging because it delivers a smaller radiation dose to the patient. The pertechnetate ion (⁹⁹ᵐTcO⁻₄) is taken up by the same tissues that take up iodine. A typical dose of ⁹⁹ᵐTc is 150 MBq (approximately 4 mCi).
- **Iodine-123 (¹²³I):** This radioisotope is also an excellent choice for thyroid imaging due to its lack of beta emission and a 13-hour half-life. A dose of about 20 MBq is used.

 --> **Thyroid Function Test**
 
**The thyroid gland plays a vital role in metabolism, growth, and development.** It produces hormones that control the body's metabolic rate. **The 24-hour uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid is one of the oldest nuclear medicine tests used to evaluate thyroid function.** This test involves administering a small amount of ¹³¹I (about 300 kBq or 8 µCi) to the patient orally, either in liquid or capsule form.

**The test is performed as follows:**
1. After 24 hours, the amount of ¹³¹I in the thyroid is counted for 1 minute.
2. The same original amount of ¹³¹I (the standard) is set aside at the beginning of the study and placed in a neck phantom after 24 hours. This standard is also counted for 1 minute. Phantoms are tools used to measure radiation in a controlled environment.
3. The ratio of the thyroid counts to the standard counts, multiplied by 100, gives the percent 24-hour uptake.

**The results of the test can indicate:**
- **Hypothyroidism:** An underactive thyroid will take up less iodine than a normal thyroid, resulting in an uptake of less than 10%.
- **Euthyroidism:** A normal thyroid has an uptake in the range of 10-40%, with an average around 20%.
- **Hyperthyroidism:** An overactive thyroid will take up more iodine than a normal thyroid, resulting in an uptake above 40%.

**It's important to note that patients with low uptake (less than 10%) may also be temporarily oversupplied with stable iodine.**

**In recent years, new in vitro thyroid tests have been developed that don't require administering ¹³¹I to the patient.** These tests are performed on blood samples and are safer as they don't involve radiation exposure to the patient.

--> **Kidney Imaging and Function Tests**

Nuclear medicine techniques are valuable tools for evaluating kidney function, especially after a kidney transplant. These techniques utilize radioactive materials that are efficiently cleared by the kidneys, allowing for visualization and assessment of their function.

**One common technique involves using a small amount of radioactive hippuric acid, which is rapidly cleared by the kidneys.** The procedure is as follows:

1. A small amount of radioactive hippuric acid is injected into the bloodstream.
2. **A gamma camera is used to visualize the kidneys and capture sequential images every few minutes.** This dynamic imaging approach allows healthcare professionals to observe the passage of the radiopharmaceutical through the kidneys.
3. **By connecting a computer to the gamma camera, renograms can be obtained simultaneously with the images.** Renograms provide graphical representations of radioactivity levels in each kidney over time, offering insights into their function.

**Alternative methods for kidney imaging may use other radioisotopes. For example, Iodine-125 is used diagnostically to evaluate the filtration rate of kidneys.**

**Analyzing the renograms and sequential images allows physicians to assess various aspects of kidney function:**

- **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):** This measures the rate at which the kidneys filter waste products from the blood. A decreased GFR may indicate kidney dysfunction.
- **Renal Blood Flow:** This assesses the blood flow to the kidneys, which is crucial for their proper functioning. Reduced blood flow can suggest problems with the blood vessels supplying the kidneys.
- **Obstruction:** Blockages in the urinary tract, such as kidney stones, can be detected by observing delays or abnormalities in the flow of the radiopharmaceutical.

**These imaging and function tests help healthcare professionals:**

- **Diagnose kidney diseases.**
- **Monitor the effectiveness of treatments.**
- **Evaluate the health of transplanted kidneys.**

In addition to the techniques described above, **other nuclear medicine procedures, such as a renal scan, can provide detailed images of the kidneys' structure and function.** These procedures help identify abnormalities like cysts, tumors, or scars that may affect kidney health.

--> **Lung Imaging and Function Tests**
Nuclear medicine techniques are particularly useful for evaluating the **air circulation system and perfusion in the lungs**.

- **Pulmonary Embolism Detection:** A common test for pulmonary embolism involves injecting macroaggregated albumin labeled with Technetium-99m (⁹⁹ᵐTc) into a vein. The aggregates are too large to pass through the lung capillaries, becoming trapped. A scan or gamma camera image reveals the distribution of functioning capillaries, with areas of reduced radioactivity indicating potential blockages.

- **Ventilation Studies:** Radioactive gases, such as Xenon-133 (¹³³Xe), can be used to assess lung ventilation. The distribution and retention of the gas provide information about airflow patterns and lung function.

--> **Heart Imaging and Function Tests**
Imaging the heart presents challenges due to its constant motion, limiting the achievable detail. However, techniques like **gating**, which synchronizes image acquisition with the electrocardiogram (ECG), can improve image quality.

- **Myocardial Perfusion Imaging:** This technique assesses blood flow to the heart muscle. Radiopharmaceuticals like Thallium-201 (²⁰¹Tl) or Technetium-99m (⁹⁹ᵐTc)-labeled agents are injected intravenously. Areas of reduced uptake may indicate coronary artery disease or damaged heart muscle.
    
- **Detection of Heart Damage:** Researchers are developing radiopharmaceuticals that concentrate in damaged heart tissue following a heart attack. It is anticipated that these agents will help determine the location and extent of heart damage.

**While the sources don't explicitly mention specific types of heart function tests using radioisotopes, the information suggests that these imaging techniques can indirectly provide valuable functional data.** By evaluating blood flow and radiopharmaceutical uptake patterns, healthcare professionals can gain insights into:

- **Heart muscle viability:** Areas of reduced perfusion may indicate non-viable or damaged heart muscle.
- **Coronary artery disease:** Blockages in the coronary arteries can be inferred from patterns of decreased blood flow.
- **Heart function:** Observing the movement of the heart walls and the ejection of blood can provide information about overall heart function.

 --> **Liver Imaging and Function Tests**
Nuclear medicine techniques are valuable for evaluating liver conditions, particularly **detecting and assessing the spread of cancer (metastases) to the liver**. These techniques utilize the liver's ability to filter radioactive particles from the blood.

**A common imaging technique involves injecting Technetium-99m (⁹⁹ᵐTc)-labeled sulfur colloid, consisting of particles approximately 0.5 µm in diameter, into a vein.**

- Normal liver tissue will effectively filter these particles from the blood.
- **Tumors in the liver, however, do not filter the particles, leading to areas of reduced radioactivity on the scan.**

**The procedure is as follows:**

1. A dose of approximately 200 MBq (about 5 mCi) of ⁹⁹ᵐTc-labeled sulfur colloid is administered intravenously.
2. After allowing approximately 10 minutes for the particles to distribute, imaging is performed using either a gamma camera or a rectilinear scanner.

**Analyzing the images allows physicians to:**

- **Identify areas of reduced radioactivity, suggesting the presence of tumors or other abnormalities.**
- **Assess the size and distribution of lesions.**
- **Evaluate treatment response by monitoring changes in lesion size or activity.**

**In addition to tumor detection, liver imaging can also help assess overall liver function.**

- Observing the distribution and clearance of the radiopharmaceutical provides information about blood flow and the liver's ability to filter substances from the blood.
- Irregularities in uptake or clearance patterns can indicate liver dysfunction.

### Bone composition & cancer detection

--> **Components and Composition of Bone**
Bone is a complex living tissue with both organic and inorganic components. The major components and their approximate percentages are:

- **Collagen:** This fibrous protein is the main organic part of bone, giving it flexibility and tensile strength. It makes up roughly **40% of the weight and 60% of the volume of solid bone**.
- **Bone Mineral:** This inorganic component, mostly **calcium hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2],** provides hardness and rigidity. It constitutes around **60% of bone weight and 40% of its volume**.
- **Water:** Bone also contains a significant amount of water, which is important for its structure and function.

--> **Detecting Bone Cancer**
Nuclear medicine techniques, particularly bone scans, are often **more effective than X-rays for detecting bone cancer**. This is because cancer often leads to increased metabolic activity and bone remodeling in the affected areas. This heightened activity results in a higher uptake of certain radioisotopes, making the cancerous regions stand out on a scan.

Here's how it works:

1. A phosphate compound labeled with a radioisotope, commonly **Technetium-99m (⁹⁹ᵐTc) **, is injected into the bloodstream.
2. After about 3 hours, a scan is performed. The scan will show **increased radioactivity in areas where bone is being destroyed and rebuilt by cancer**. This is because these areas are taking up more of the radioisotope than normal bone.

**Another radioisotope used for bone scans is Fluorine-18 (¹⁸F), which fits into the bone crystal structure**. However, ¹⁸F has a short half-life and must be produced close to where it will be used.

**It's important to remember that other conditions, like arthritis or fractures, can also cause increased radioisotope uptake, so careful interpretation of bone scan results is crucial.**
