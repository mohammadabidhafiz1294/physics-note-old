### Vacant site vs Interstitial site 
 Vacancies, interstitials, and substitutions are three of them. **A vacancy is where an atom is missing from its lattice site**. The number of vacancies in a metal crystal increases as the temperature increases. An interstitial is an atom that occupies the space between the atoms on the lattice sites.

### Schottky defect vs Frenkel Defect

 **Schottky defect** occurs when oppositely charged atoms (cation and anion) leave their corresponding lattice sites and create a pair of Vacancy Defects. Since both cation and anion leave the lattice sites at the same time, so overall electrical neutrality of the crystal is maintained; however, density reduces because of the vacancies. Schottky defects occur in ionic crystals where the size of anion is almost same with the size of the cation.

 **Frenkel Defect** is one type of point defect where an atom (better to say ion, especially cation) leaves its original lattice site and occupies an interstitial position on the same crystal. Usually, this type of defect is observed in ionic solids, where size of anion is substantially larger than the size of cation.

## #Atom vs #molecule vs #valency

Molecule, atom, and valency are terms used in chemistry to describe different aspects of chemical structures and bonding:

1. *Atom*: An atom is the basic unit of matter and the smallest indivisible particle of an element. Each element is composed of atoms, and each atom consists of a nucleus (containing protons and neutrons) surrounded by electrons in energy levels or shells. Atoms can combine with other atoms through chemical bonding to form molecules and compounds.
    
2. *Molecule*: A molecule is a group of two or more atoms chemically bonded together. It can be composed of atoms of the same element or different elements. Molecules can be simple, like diatomic molecules (e.g., O2, N2), or complex, like water (H2O) or glucose (C6H12O6). The atoms in a molecule are held together by chemical bonds, which can be covalent, ionic, or metallic, depending on the nature of the bonding electrons.
    
3. *Valency* (Valence): Valency, also known as valence, is a measure of the combining capacity of an atom to form chemical bonds with other atoms. It represents the number of electrons an atom can gain, lose, or share to achieve a stable electronic configuration. The valency of an atom is related to the number of valence electrons, which are the electrons found in the outermost energy level or shell of the atom.
    

**For example:**

- In the case of hydrogen (H), it has one valence electron and can form one chemical bond by sharing its electron with another atom to create H2 (hydrogen molecule).
- Oxygen (O) has six valence electrons and can form two chemical bonds, leading to the formation of diatomic oxygen (O2) molecules.

> Understanding the concept of valency helps predict the types and numbers of chemical bonds that atoms can form when they combine to create molecules or compounds. The valency of elements is an essential factor in understanding chemical reactions and the formation of different chemical substances.


### Thermodynamic Probability
Thermodynamic probability, also known as statistical probability or Boltzmann probability, is a concept in statistical thermodynamics that describes the likelihood of a particular microstate occurring within a given macroscopic system.

In statistical thermodynamics, a macroscopic system consists of a large number of microscopic particles (such as atoms or molecules), and each microscopic particle can exist in different energy states. The collection of all possible energy states of the system is known as the #microstate.

The thermodynamic probability (P) of a specific microstate is given by the Boltzmann distribution, which is expressed as:

P = exp(-E / kT)

where: P = Thermodynamic probability of the microstate E = Energy of the microstate k = Boltzmann constant (a fundamental constant in physics) T = Temperature of the system

According to the Boltzmann distribution, the thermodynamic probability of a microstate is proportional to the negative exponential of its energy divided by the product of the Boltzmann constant and the temperature.

In simpler terms, the Boltzmann distribution tells us that the probability of finding a system in a particular microstate decreases with increasing energy and increasing temperature. Microstates with lower energy and lower temperature have higher probabilities of being realized in the system.

By considering the thermodynamic probability of various microstates, statistical thermodynamics provides a statistical description of macroscopic properties of the system, such as temperature, pressure, and entropy. It allows us to understand and predict the behavior of macroscopic systems based on the statistical properties of their constituent microscopic particles.

### #Boltzman-constant

**Boltzmann constant**, (symbol _k_), a fundamental constant of [physics](https://www.britannica.com/science/physics-science) occurring in nearly every statistical formulation of both classical and quantum physics. The constant is named after [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludwig-Boltzmann), a 19th-century Austrian physicist, who substantially contributed to the foundation and development of statistical mechanics, a branch of theoretical physics. Having dimensions of [energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/energy) per degree of [temperature](https://www.britannica.com/science/temperature), the Boltzmann constant has a defined value of 1.380649 × 10−23 [joule](https://www.britannica.com/science/joule) per [kelvin](https://www.britannica.com/science/kelvin) (K), or 1.380649 × 10−16 [erg](https://www.britannica.com/science/erg-measurement) per kelvin. The [molar gas constant](https://www.britannica.com/science/universal-gas-constant) _R_ is defined as Avogadro’s number times the Boltzmann constant.

The physical significance of _k_ is that **it provides a measure of the amount of energy (i.e., heat) corresponding to the random thermal motions of the particles making up a substance**. For a classical system at [equilibrium](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/equilibrium) at temperature _T_, the average energy per [degree of freedom](https://www.britannica.com/science/degree-of-freedom-mathematics-and-statistics) is _k__T_/2. In the simplest example of a [gas](https://www.britannica.com/science/gas-state-of-matter) consisting of _N_ non-interacting [atoms](https://www.britannica.com/science/atom), each atom has three translational degrees of freedom (it can move in the _x_-, _y_-, or _z_-directions), and so the total [thermal energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/thermal-energy) of the gas is 3_N__kbT_/2.

### Burger's Vector

  The Burgers vector of a dislocation is **a crystal vector, specified by Miller indices, that quantifies the difference between the distorted lattice around the dislocation and the perfect lattice**.

Equivalently, the Burgers vector denotes the direction and magnitude of the atomic displacement that occurs when a dislocation moves.

To determine the Burgers vector of a dislocation in a two-dimensional primitive square lattice, proceed as follows:

Trace around the end of the dislocation plane to form a closed loop. Record the number of lattice vectors travelled along each side of the loop (shown here by the numbers in the boxes):

In a perfect lattice, trace out the same path, moving the same number of lattice vectors along each direction as before. This loop will not be complete, and the closure failure is the Burgers vector:

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$
$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{eyelid}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T}\sum_{v=1}^{V}\mathcal{M}_{v}^{\mathrm{(eyelid)}}(\hat{h}_{t,v}-x_{t,v}^{2})$$
