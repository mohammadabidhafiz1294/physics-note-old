## Introduction
 
 A branch of physics that deals with the effects arising from the interactions of electric currents with magnets, with other currents, or with themselves.

4 laws of electrodynamics

The operation of electric motors is governed by various laws of electricity and magnetism, including Faraday's law of induction, Amp√®re's circuital law, Lenz' law, and the Lorentz force.
