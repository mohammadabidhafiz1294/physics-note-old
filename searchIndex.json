		"content": "what is the more sustainable in atom ?? electron /proton /neutron??\nAnswer: Yes. An electron has no internal structure, and is the lightest fundamental particle with a non-zero electric charge. Therefore it cannot spontaneously decay into a lighter particle without violating charge conservation. So any transformation of an electron must either involve adding a large amount of energy to it, or an interaction with another particle (e.g. electron capture or electron-positron annihilation).\n\nProtons and neutrons, however, are made up of quarks. Outside of a nucleus, a free neutron spontaneously decays into a proton, an electron and a #Neutrino, with a half-life of about 14 minutes. A free proton does not spontaneously decay in a similar way (as far as we know) because its mass is slightly less than the mass of a neutron. However, both neutrons and protons inside unstable nuclei can spontaneously decay via beta decay.\n\n#Neutrino : Neutrinos are the most abundant particles that have mass in the universe. Every time atomic nuclei come together (like in the sun) or break apart (like in a nuclear reactor), they produce neutrinos. Even a banana emits neutrinos—they come from the natural radioactivity of the potassium in the fruit.",
